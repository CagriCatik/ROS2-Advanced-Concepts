# Advanced ROS 2 Concepts

## Introduction

This document outlines advanced concepts in ROS 2 for those who have mastered the basics and wish to explore more complex functionalities. This course adopts a practical, hands-on approach to facilitate learning through direct application.

## Course Origin

The development of this course was driven by the need to provide clear and comprehensive information on intermediate and advanced ROS 2 concepts. These concepts were often challenging to find and understand, leading to the creation of a structured learning path designed to save time and reduce frustration.

## Course Objectives

The objective of this course is to provide a thorough understanding of intermediate and advanced ROS 2 functionalities. Mastery of these concepts will enhance capabilities as a ROS developer, enabling the application of this knowledge to various projects and frameworks, including ROS 2 Control, the Navigation Stack, and MoveIt.

## Prerequisites

A solid understanding of ROS 2 basics is required before starting this course. Necessary skills include:

- Creating a package
- Creating a node
- Creating a subscriber
- Working with callbacks
- Using the command line

For those new to ROS 2, it is recommended to complete foundational courses such as "ROS 2 for Beginners, Level One" and "Level Two." However, Level Two may be skipped if the foundational knowledge is sufficient.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four main parts, each focusing on a crucial ROS 2 concept:

1. **ROS 2 Actions**
2. **Lifecycle Nodes**
3. **Executors**
4. **Components**

Learning is facilitated through hands-on lessons, complemented by additional challenges to practice and integrate multiple concepts.

### Part 1: ROS 2 Actions

ROS 2 Actions are essential for tasks requiring feedback and the ability to be preempted. Topics covered include:

- Structure of ROS 2 Actions
- Creating and using action servers and clients
- Implementing feedback and goal cancellation

### Part 2: Lifecycle Nodes

Lifecycle Nodes provide better control over node states. This part covers:

- Node lifecycle management
- Transition states
- Writing lifecycle-aware nodes

### Part 3: Executors

Executors handle callbacks in ROS 2. This section explores:

- The role of executors
- Different types of executors
- Customizing executors for specific use cases

### Part 4: Components

Components facilitate modular and reusable code. This part includes:

- The concept of components in ROS 2
- Creating and using components
- Integrating components into projects

## Hands-On Learning and Challenges

The course emphasizes hands-on lessons to reinforce the concepts being taught. Additional challenges are provided to integrate and apply multiple concepts, aiding in the development of a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2.
